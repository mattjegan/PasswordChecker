#PasswordChecker

##Aim
To create a simple password strength checker based on the one found at [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=password+strength)

##The Logic
The citeria of a good password are as follows:

- [ ] A good length
- [ ] Upper-case letters
- [ ] Lower-case letters
- [ ] Numbers
- [ ] Special Characters
- [ ] Middle numbers or special characters
- [ ] Not letters only
- [ ] Not numbers only
- [ ] No repeating characters
- [ ] No consecutive upper-case letters
- [ ] No consecutive lower-case letters
- [ ] No consecutive numbers
- [ ] No sequential letters
- [ ] No sequential numbers
- [ ] No dictionary words
